Li2CO3, Mn2O3, and Nb2O5 were mixed in a Retsch PM200 planetary ball mill for 5 h and then pressed into a pellet.
The pellet was sintered at 1000 °C for 12 h under argon gas flow.
The LNMO active material and carbon black were mixed by ball milling at 300 rpm for 4 h.
The mixture was then manually mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and rolled into thin film.
The weight ratio of the LNMO active material, carbon black, and binder in the electrode is 70:20:10.
Cells were assembled following earlier reports and cycled on an Arbin battery tester using a current of 10 mA/g at room temperature or 55 °C.
