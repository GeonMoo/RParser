Dy3+-dopedCaMoO4 phosphors were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. 
Na2MoO4*2H2O (A.R.), Ca(NO3)2*nH2O (A.R.), Sr(NO3)2 (A.R.), Ba(NO3)2 (A.R.), Eu2O3 (99.99%), Tb4O7 (99.99%), Dy2O3 (99.99%) were used as starting materials. 
In a typical process, stoichiometric weights of Dy2O3 or Eu2O3 ,Tb4O7 were dissolved in dilute nitric acid with stirring, and the superfluous HNO3 was removed by heating. 
M(NO3)2*nH2O of deionized water were added to the above solution, resulting in the formation of the mixed colorless solution. 
Meanwhile, 3.0 mmol of Na2MoO4*2H2O was dissolved into 20 mL of deionized water. 
Then, the above mixed solution was dropped into Na2MoO4 solution slowly under vigorous stirring. 
White precipitate was immediately observed in the glass beaker. The pH value of the precursor solution was then adjusted to 7 by using diluted NaOH solution under stirring. 
The vigorous stirring was kept for 30 min. 
Finally, the precursor solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflonlined stainless steel autoclave, which was subsequently sealed and maintained at 120 #C for 12 h. 
After that, the autoclave was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. 
The resulting precursors were separated by centrifugation, washed by deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried in vacuum at 70 #C.
At last, the final samples were obtained.
