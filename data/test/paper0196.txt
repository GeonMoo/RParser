All the rare earth oxide used in this work including Y2O3, Yb2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Ho2O3 with purity of 99.99% were purchased from Changchun Applied Chemistry Science and Technology Limited, China. 
Other initial materials including analytical grade Ba(NO3)2, NaBF4, NH4F, NaF, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corporation. 
All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
In a typical procedure for the synthesis of BaYF5:Yb/Er NCs, 0.2021 g (0.79 mmol) Y2O3, 0.0788 g (0.2 mmol) Yb2O3 and 0.0038 g (0.01 mmol) Er2O3 were dissolved in dilute HNO3 solution with heating and stirring until the superfluous HNO3 was removed and pH value reached between 2 and 3. 
The obtained rare earth nitrate and 0.5227 g (2 mmol) Ba(NO3)2 were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water. 
Then 5 mL of EDTA solution (molar ratio with RE 3+ was 2/1) was added slowly into the previous solution with intense stirring for 15 min. 
After that, 10 mL of solution containing 2.7449 g (25 mmol) NaBF4 was added dropwise under continuous stirring. 
The final pH value of the solution was adjusted to 10 with ammonia (25 wt.%). 
After further stirring for 10 min, the as-obtained mixing solution was transferred into a 50 mL Ten bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 180 #C for 24 h. 
As the autoclave cooled to room temperature naturally, the precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 80 #C for 6 h to gain the final sample. 
BaYF5:Yb/Tm (Ho) with the doping concentration of 20 mol% of Yb 3+ to Y 3+ and 1 mol% of Tm3+(Ho3+) to Y3+ were synthesized similarly to the above procedure. 
Other samples were also prepared by a similar procedure except that NaBF4 was replaced by NaF (4.1988 g, 100 mmol) and NH4F (3.7036 g, 100 mmol). 
In addition, different pH value (3 and 7) was selected to investigate the size and morphological evolution process of BaYF5:Yb/Er products using NaBF4 as the F- source.
