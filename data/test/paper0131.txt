Crystals of Ti11(Sb,Sn)8 were unintentionally prepared while investigating the Sn-flux synthesis (11) of the hypothetical rare earth transition metal compound (12),Yb14TiSb11. 
The synthesis of single crystals of Ti11(Sb,Sn)8 using Sn flux was successfully repeated by heating the mixture of Ti and Sb in a Sn fluux (Ti : Sb : Sn mole ratio = 11 : 4.5 : 89) at 1100 #C for 1 h with a cooling rate of 2 #C/h to 700 #C. 
Titanium (Johnson Matthey, 99.99%, +20 mesh), 1~3 mm antimony shot (CERAC, 99.999%), and tin granules (Alfa, 99.99%) were used for the reaction.
The elements were placed into an alumina crucible capped with quartz wool and sealed in a quartz ampoule under 1/5 atm pressure of purified Ar. 
The reactants were handled in a N2-filled drybox with water levels less than 1 ppm. 
The quartz ampoule containing products was spun in a centrifuge to remove the Sn-flux liquid from crystals at the final temperature of 700 #C. 
Highly reflective needle-shaped crystals grown from the wall of the alumina crucible in the flux reaction were used for X-ray structure determination and physical property measurements. 
These crystals are stable in air.
The same phase powder product was also made by reacting the stoichiometric amount of elements (Ti : Sb : Sn, 11 : 4.5 : 3.5) in a sealed tantalum tube at 1100 #C for 10 days. 
Experimental X-ray diffraction patterns were compared with that calculated from single-crystal X-ray data for Ti11(Sb,Sn)8 by CrystalDiffract v 2.0 (13). 
In a similar fashion, attempts were made to synthesize the two end members of the title compound, Ti11Sb8 and Ti11Sn8. 
Synthesis of the As analog of the title compound, Ti11As4.5Sn3.5, was also attempted by heating the stoichiometric elements (Ti : As : Sn, 11 : 4.5 : 89) in an alumina crucible using Sn-flux reaction and by heating the elements (Ti : As : Sn, 11 : 4.5 : 3.5) in a sealed tantalum tube at 1100 #C for 10 days.
