Fine powders of white Gd2O3 and dark grey B-Rh2O3 of purity greater than 99.9% are dried under flowing Ar gas at 850 K and then mixed in the desired stoichiometric ratio to make GdRhO3. 
The powders are ground together in an agate mortar. 
The homogeneous mixture is pelletized at 150 MPa using a steel die, placed in an alumina crucible and heated at 1373 K for a total duration of ~360 ks under dry flowing oxygen gas for synthesizing GdRhO3. 
The pellets are placed on a sacrcial pellet of the same composition to avoid contamination by the crucible material. 
At intervals of ~90 ks, the samples are removed from the furnace, cooled to room temperature, ground thoroughly and re-pelletized for further heat treatment. 
The formation of a single phase brown colored GdRhO3 is confirmed by XRD. 
The lattice parameters of GdRhO3 with space group Pbnm (62) are a = 0.52778 nm, b = 0.57585 nm, c = 0.76590 nm. 
GdRhO3 has GdFeO3-type distorted perovskite structure. 
Since a < c/ p 2<b, the structure may be classified as Otype perovskite; distortion is caused by size effect. 
Gd2O3 has cubic C-rare earth structure (space group Ia3), with lattice parameter a = 1.081 nm. 
B-Rh2O3 has corundum type orthorhombic structure (space group Pbca (61)), with lattice parameters a = 0.5148 nm, b = 0.5438 nm, c = 1.4693 nm.
