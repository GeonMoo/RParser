Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3 , 99%), silver nitrate (AgNO3 , 99%), and 1-dodecanol (99%) used in the experimental work were of analytical grade, supplied by SigmaeAldrich and used as received. 
The typical synthesis procedure is as follow: ammonium metavanadate (0.1 mmol), silver nitrate (0.1 mmol) and 1.0 mL of 1-dodecanol were mixed, ground for 1 h in a mortar and then calcined at 450 # C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. 
The resulting AgVO3 nanoparticles were collected and subjected to further analysis.
