Ytterbium, copper and germanium elements were mixed in the ideal 2:1:6 and 3:4:4 atomic ratios for Yb2CuGe6 and Yb3Cu4Ge4 , respectively, and sealed in tantalum ampoules under argon atmosphere in an arc-melting apparatus. 
The tantalum ampoules were subsequently placed in a water-cooled sample chamber of an induction furnace (Easy Heat induction heating system, Model 7590), first rapidly heated to 170 Amp (ca. 1200--1350 K) and then kept at that temperature for 30 min. 
Finally, the reaction was rapidly cooled to room temperature by switching off the power supply. 
Both compounds could easily be removed from the tantalum tubes. 
No reactions with the crucible material could be detected. 
Both compounds were found to be stable in moist air for several months. 
Both are in polycrystalline form and light grey in color. 
The weight losses of the final material were less than 2%. 
The samples obtained from the high frequency induction heating method were used for the magnetic and resistivity studies.
