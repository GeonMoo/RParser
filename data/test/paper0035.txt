The conventional solid state reaction method was used for the synthesis of the Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphor. 
Gadolinium Oxide (Gd2O3), Erbium Oxide (Er2O3) and Ytterbium Oxide (Yb2O3) of high purity (99.99%) chemicals were purchased by Sigma-Aldrich and used as precursor material.
The stoichiometric ratios of these chemicals were weighed and ground in to a fine powder by using agate mortar and pestle. 
The ground sample was placed in an alumina crucible and heated at 1000 #C for 1 h and 1400 #C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. 
The sample is allowed to cool at room temperature in the same furnace. 
Every heating is followed by intermediate grinding using agate mortar and pestle. 
The mixtures of reagents were grounded together for 45 min to obtain a homogeneous powder. 
The Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphor containing variable Yb concentration with fixed Er concentration and vice versa have been synthesized by the above mentioned method.
