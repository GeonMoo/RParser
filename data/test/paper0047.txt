The Cd2SnO4 powder was prepared from the solid state reaction of the well-blended mixture of required quantities of CdO (99.99% pure-Merck) and SnO2 (99.99% pure-Merck) in the atomic weight ratio of 2 : 1.
The mixed binary oxides, after making them as a 5 mm thick 50 mm diameter pellet, were kept at 1050 #C for 6 hours in an autotuned, PID controlled SiC furnace at air atmosphere. 
The optimized time duration was selected based on the monophase compound formation which was confirmed through XRD results. 
The Zn2SnO4 powder was also prepared as mentioned above, from the well-blended mixture of the ZnO (99.99% pure-Merck chemicals) and SnO2 (99.99% pure-Merck chemicals) in the atomic weight ratio of 2:1.
The pellet was kept at 900 #C in air for 4 hours.
The temperature conditions were selected on the basis of thermal analysis results in both cases.
