Single crystals of NaLnGeO4 (Ln Sm, Eu, Gd) were grown out of a molten sodium hydroxide flux. 
The sodium hydroxide is commercially available and contains approximately 15% water by weight. 
In a typical procedure, 0.5 mmol of Ln2O3 (prefired at 1000 #C for 24 h), 2 mmol of GeO2 , and 4 g of NaOH were placed together into silver tubes approximately 10 cm long with a diameter of 1.25 cm, which had been flame-sealed at one end. 
After loading the reagents in to the vessel, the silver tubes were crimped shut and folded over twice before heating. 
For all compositions, the reaction mixtures were heated to 600 #C at a rate of 10 #C/min, held for 12 h, and then cooled to 400 #C at a rate of 4 #C/h. 
At this point the furnace was shut off and allowed to cool to room temperature. 
The hydroxide flux was dissolved in water, aided by the process of sonication, and the crystals were washed with water and acetone and isolated by vacuum filtration. 
For the Sm member, the product contained only crystals of NaSmGeO4, while the Eu and Gd reactions yielded mixed phase products.
Polycrystalline samples of NaEuGeO4, NaGdGeO4 and NaTbGeO4 were synthesized via conventional solid state methods. 
Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, Ln2O3, and GeO2 were thoroughly ground together and loaded into alumina crucibles. 
The mixtures were heated to 950 #C, held for 2d, and cooled to room temperature, with intermittent grindings. 
The purity of ground crystals and powder sample was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction as seen in Fig. S1.
