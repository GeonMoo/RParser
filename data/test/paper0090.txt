Single crystals of Pb3(Mn1-xFex)7O15 manganites with 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 were grown by a flux method. 
As a flux, PbO was chosen, known as an effective solvent for many oxide compounds and preventing incorporation of foreign ions into the lattice. 
The synthesis was started with heating the mixture of appropriate amounts of high purity PbO, Mn2O3, and Fe2O3 in a platinum crucible at 1000 #C for 4 h. 
Then, the crucible was slowly cooled down to 900 #C with the rate 1/h and, finally, the furnace was cooled to room temperature. 
Single crystals of a platehexagonal shape with black shiny facets were found at the solidified liquid surface. 
The plates were up to 40 mm in "diameter". 
The grown crystals were mechanically extracted from the flux. 
The magnetic measurements reported in this study were performed on well-polished plate-like samples of the required dimension that were cut from the resulting single-crystal plates. 
The samples were oriented by the back-Laue method.
