The title compound was prepared from reaction mixtures of H3PO4(3.75 mmol), ethylenediamine (3.75 mmol), and NiCl2*6H2O (0.75 mmol) in a mixture of approximately 15 mL of water and 1-butanol (volume ratio 1 : 2). 
The initial pH of the reaction was approximately 9. The synthesis was carried out in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined stainless steel container under autogeneous pressure, filled to approximately 75% volume capacity, and all reactants were sitrred briefly before heating.
The reaction mixture was heated at 170 #C for 6 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature.
The pH of the reaction decreased to approximately 5.
The resulting product was filted off, washed with ether, and dried in air.
