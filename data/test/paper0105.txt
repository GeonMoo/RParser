Polycrystalline samples with nominal compositions of La0.7Ca0.3MnO(3-sigma)F0.6 were synthesized by the standard solid-state reaction method. 
Stoichiometric amounts of high purity La2O3 (99.99%), CaCO3 (99.997%), CaF2 (99.985%) and MnO2 (99.997%) powders were mixed and calcined in air at 900 #C for 12 h and cooled to the room temperature with a cooling rate of 5 #C/min. 
Then, the calcined powders were ground thoroughly and sintered at 1200 #C for 20 h with two intermediate grindings to ensure complete reaction. 
The sintered mixtures were regrounded and pressed into pellets. 
Finally, the pellets were annealed at 1350 #C for 20 h. 
The samples with x=0.0 and 0.6 will be noted hereafter by LC00 and LC06, respectively. 
The crystalline structure and phase purity of samples were investigated by the step scanned powder diffraction pattern recorded at room temperature using a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer with the CuKa radiation. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 6390-LV) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) have been employed to study the surface morphology and the chemical composition of the samples, respectively. 
The oxygen contents were determined with the help of standard redox titrations with KMnO4 and sodium oxalate solutions. 
The electrical resistivity measurements of the samples were carried out as a function of temperature at various magnetic fields (up to 7 T) by a four-wire method in a He-gas contact cryocooler and superconducting coil magnet from CRY Industries. 
Zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) DC magnetization measurements were performed by using a 7304 model Lake Shore Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM).
