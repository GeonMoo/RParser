Separately, 0.02 mol of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of water to form a clear solution (A).
A total of 0.02 mol of (NH4)2HPO4 and 20 g of Na2CO3 were dissolved in 100 mL of water to form a clear solution (B).
Solution A was then quickly added to solution B under fast magnetic stirring.
The obtained slurry was then transferred to a glass bottle sealed with a cap.
The bottle was heated in a 120 °C oil bath in an Ar flushed glovebox for 4−72 h, after which it was taken out of the oil bath and slowly cooled down to room temperature.
The slurry was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and methanol several times to separate the solids.
The solid samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight.
