Ytterbium, copper and germanium elements were mixed in the ideal 2:1:6 and 3:4:4 atomic ratios for Yb2CuGe6 and Yb3Cu4Ge4 , respectively, and sealed in tantalum ampoules under argon atmosphere in an arc-melting apparatus. 
The tantalum ampoules were subsequently placed in a water-cooled sample chamber of an induction furnace (Easy Heat induction heating system, Model 7590), first rapidly heated to 170 Amp (ca. 1200--1350 K) and then kept at that temperature for 30 min. 
Finally, the reaction was rapidly cooled to room temperature by switching off the power supply.
