The raw materials were IOT, CaCO3, SiO2, and Ce(NO3)3*6H2O (analytical grade, 99.0%). 
IOT came from Hebei province of China, which is the remaining materials derived from iron ore by crushing, sieving, grinding, and flotation. 
Its chemical compositions were given in the mass ratio as follows: SiO2, 30.09%; Fe2O3, 28.02%; Al2O3, 11.73%; TiO2, 10.97%; CaO, 5.64%; MgO, 4.33%; Na2O, 1.78%; loss on ignition, 5.67%; others, 1.77%.
The weight percentages of Ce in the experimental group are 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 wt.%, noted as C3, C5, C7, C9, and C11, respectively; while in the control group was noted as C0.
Given below are the experimental details. 
The raw materials were first dissolved in deionized water to obtain a mixed solution with an appropriate proportion (IOT: CaCO3 :SiO2 = 6:1:1, the ratio was obtained according to results of orthogonal experiments).
The solution was dried at 120 #C for 6h and then pressed into ceramic body at 70MPa. 
Then the ceramic bodies were put into a furnace for finally sintering. 
The prepared ceramics were crushed into fine powder with the help of an agate mortar. 
The sintering process is as follows: Stage I, room temperature to 900 #C with heating rate of 2.4 #C/min; Stage II, 900--1150 #C with heating rate of 2.8 #C/min; Stage III, 1150 #C was kept for 2h; Stage IV, slowly cooled to room temperature.
